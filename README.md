# HourlyNotification

Creative project for the [Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps](https://www.coursera.org/course/androidapps101/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

## Description
Sends an hourly notification on the minute of the user's choosing.

## Assignment Details
* These apps must be brand new, created from scratch, and created purely for this assignment for this particular instance of this course. You may not reuse layouts or text from existing Android projects. The purpose here is to prove to yourself that you really can create a new app that satisfies the above requirements.
* The app's manifest file must not specify any permissions.
* The app may only perform its stated or specified purpose. The app must not perform anything malicious or hide any devious actions.
* The app should meet reasonable expectations of decency to a worldwide audience. To use a movie analogy, in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and possibly others, this would be a "G" or "PG" rating; in the United Kingdom, a “U” or “PG” rating; in India, a “U” rating. We're not stopping you from making other kinds of apps—just don't submit them as an assignment!
* Your apps must at least work on emulator level 10. To have confidence in your expected score, check to make sure that your app works on an emulator API level 10 and other higher-level emulators or devices if you have them.
